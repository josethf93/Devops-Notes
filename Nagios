why we need system monitoring 

intro of nagios

object 

object type 

how to install server nagios 

if you wanna reset , go inside /usr/local/nagiosxi

resetnagiospassword = newpassword

how to configure 


two types 

infa monitoring 

application monitoring ( different ball game)

define SLA by using nagios 

example of continous monitoring 

do i need to check cross browser compatibility 

artificial thinking , pattern in logs 

take preventive factors

what is acceptable and what is not acceptable 

these tools help us resolve any system erros 
low memory per say 


so we can prevent impact on productivity

will detect network / server problems

determines the root cause

maintains secuity and availability 

it monitors and troubleshoot server performance issues

these provide basic rudimentary checking

nagios scheduler will run as daemon is background

checks at regular intervals

ps -ef | grep nagios

we have -d which is daemon

and workers as well

nagios remote plugin execution

notification commands

four types of status check

ok warning critical and unknows

attempt 4/4 ( critical )

we have to mark the implications very carefully 


1/4(critical) , 2/4(critical) , 3/4(critical) , 4/4 (ok)

3 times it failed , 4th connected but this should be avoided

as you are more vulnerable for risk 


please assess at the first time itself



ac attemped count< mca (max checked attempts )

lets not blame nagios , for example 

1 hour is the interval check and 24 is MCA

now , 5 o clock u left office , you will never get to know 

till next day 5 o clock . because interval time is 1 hour 

and max attempts is 24 which means 24 hours your system is down


usr /local/nagios /libexec (here we have all plugins installed)

we have perl plugin and non perl plugin

for example on plugin 

./check_ssh 192.168.1.11

it replies ssh ok 

./check_ssh nagios.demo.com

it replies ssh ok

the same thing we see inside the nagios 

one more example 

./check_users -w 1 -c 2 (1 means ok , 2 means critical)

the above says ok

./check_users -w 0 -c 1 

the above is warning , as we set limit if more than 0 throw warning

./check_users -w 0 -c 0 

the above says critical 

and if i print echo$? it says 2 (2 means critical )

./check_users -w 0 -c 1

if i print echo$? it says 1 ( warning) 


./check_users -w 2 -c 5

if i print echo$? it says 0 ( ok)

values for the states are as follows 

0 -ok
1- warning
2- critical 
3- unknown
the above is for currently logged in users


for customized plugins , we have the following command for plugin

./check_tcp -H 192.168.1.10 -p 80 -w 0.05 -c 0.01


tcp ok  


echo$? says 0

./check_uptime 

uptime ok



objects
------

/usr/local/nagios/etc

vi nagios.cfg

this has 

cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/servers.cfg

cfg_dir/usr/local/nagios/etc/servers  ( here i came group all files together

and keep them here in this directory)

ex : one for prod , dev , qa etc


one of those files for contacts is 

cfg_file=/usr/local/nagios/etc/objects/users.cfg

in this define contactgroup

members we can edit , nagiosadmin nagiosadmin2

templates.cfg

search for generic inside this file

24x7 ( default)

flapping up and down --

for such things we can define notify service by email

service_notification_period - workdays (only weekdays) (contacts.cfg)

this timeperiod can be changed in timeperiods.cfg

u can change here 

like 

timeperiodname_24x7

workhours

monday 

tuesday ...etc...

define work hours here

like 8 to 6 etc .


similarly 

holiday list can be defined as follows


january1   00:00-00:00:00 ; NewYearsDay  ( zero time means no time so

that denotes as holiday)


classic example is like as follows

for production servers i will configure email 24x7 

and for dev and qa server i will configure (holidays , weekends excluded)

hosts

define host {

linux-server

template definition

we can grop servers 

in define hostgroup {

dev servers one group ..etc

commands.cfg 

define command {

$HOSTNAME 

for ex: 192.15.4.4 

the same alert is printed here as sorry 192.15 is down


services.cfg

what should be the notification ( where the service applicable to)

define service 

check_ping !100.0,20%

this will call command.cfg 

in this 

we can check_ping -H $HOSTNAME -w 3000 -c $ARG$


on the server side

we need to add in commands.cfg

define command {
command_name check_nrpe
command_line $USER1$/check_nrpe -H $HOSTADDRESS -c $ARG1$

the above enables nrpe

--

nagios notification 

we have to enable the notification filter

etc flapping can be notified etc ..

installation 

of ubuntu

INSTALL_Nagios_Ubuntu_14.txt 


./check_http -I 192.168.1.11 -p 8080


just to check if everything is working fine 

now 

vi command.cfg

check nrpe

vi servers.cfg

host definition
